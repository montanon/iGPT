Unlike fiat currencies, however,\\ncryptocurrencies base their value exclusively on the trust\\nof the investors: except those implementations that base\\ntheir value on traditional financial assets (i.e. stablecoins\\nlike Tether or Security Token Offerings), no central\\nbanks and monetary reserves can influence the supply\\nof money and, as such, indirectly control inflation. Also\\nfor these motivations, often the economical value of the\\ncryptocurrencies is subject to high fluctuations.\\nBitcoin, launched in 2009, was the ancestor of all\\nthe other cryptocurrencies and it is even now by far the\\nmost popular and the most used one [29]. In view of\\nthe success of Bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies were\\ncreated in the last decade: according to [1], currently there\\nare over 3500 types of cryptocurrencies, with the global\\ncryptomarket worth almost 400 billion dollars. However, as\\nreported by [1], Bitcoin still holds 64% of the cryptomarket\\ncapitalization, with Ethereum steadily in the second place\\nwith the 11%.\\nThe cryptomarket is currently still growing and there\\nare different reasons why one might be fascinated by\\nthis technology: some users might be interested in the\\nanonymity (or pseudo-anonymity) features [27], others in\\nthe lack of central entities in charge of managing the money\\ntransfers, in the economic value of the cryptocurrencies built\\nover these ledgers (for example, for speculation purposes),\\nor finally, with the aim to build decentralized applications\\n / Published online: 9 August 2021\\n Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications (2022) 15:839–853\\n\\nthat are able to exploit the features offered by smart\\ncontracts [24].\\nBlockchains and cryptocurrencies have been widely\\nstudied in these last years. Mostly, the domains of\\ninvestigation are related to security issues [7, 26], usage\\nin Internet of Things deployments and drones [13,\\n33], Smart Cities environments [12, 21, 36], large-scale\\nheterogeneous networks [32], as well as on their economical\\nimpact [22].\\nIn this paper, we follow a totally different approach, in\\nfact we perform a study of these technologies by relying\\non mechanisms that are typical of the (social) networks\\nanalysis (e.g. [17, 37]). Thus, we study the interactions\\namong the accounts involved in the transactions that are\\nrecorded on the Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs).\\nFor this purpose, the system to be studied is treated as a\\ngraph, where links are drawn when pairs of accounts have\\na some sort of interaction. This kind of analysis is viable,\\nsince unlike normal methods for exchanging money, the\\nwhole set of transactions is traced in the distributed ledger\\nand furthermore it is visible to everyone [16].\\nTo this aim, we devised and implemented a novel\\nsoftware tool called DiLeNa (Distributed Ledger Network\\nAnalyzer)1.\\nThis software is able to grab the transactions stored in the\\ndistributed ledger of different DLTs, create an abstraction of\\na network and then measure some important related metrics,\\nwhich allow to extract some peculiar characteristics of the\\nnetwork.\\nWe claim that these metrics can provide insights on the\\nrespective technologies and on the use that users make of\\nthem.\\nSpecifically, in our work we apply this approach to four\\ndifferent DLTs, namely Bitcoin, DogeCoin, Ethereum and\\nRipple. The analysis on their transactions graphs reveals\\nthat the networks -some more, some less- feature a small\\nworld behaviour, and that most of the nodes have very few\\nconnections, even though some hubs with a very high degree\\nexist. The exhibited behaviour is supposed to be influenced\\nby the considered time interval and by the implementation\\nfeatures of the DLTs, so different types of transactions\\ngraphs have been taken into account. We think that the\\napproach we propose in this paper, should help to get more\\ninformation about how interactions through DLTs occur and\\nthat it could have useful applications, such as for anti-money\\nlaundering purposes.\\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows.\\nSection 2 introduces some background and related work.\\n 1An early version of this work appeared in [31]. This paper is an\\nextensively revised and extended version where more than 50% is new\\nmaterial.\\n Section 3 describes the design choices of the software tool\\nand deals with the critical aspects of its implementation.\\nSection 4 analyzes the results obtained by analyzing\\nthe some relevant distributed ledgers. Finally, Sections 5\\nprovides some concluding remarks.\\n 2 Background and related work\\n In this section, some background that is essential to\\nunderstand the rest of the paper is introduced. Specifically,\\nthe topics covered will be the DLT technology, the\\nrepresentation of complex systems as graphs and some\\nmetrics that can be used in order to evaluate the specific\\ncharacteristics of a network (e.g. small world property).\\n 2.1 DLT and blockchain technologies\\n Cryptocurrencies, unlike traditional banking systems, store\\ntheir data into distributed ledgers, thus making the\\ninformation decentralized and avoiding single points of\\nfailure. DLTs work as distributed and immutable databases\\nand the nodes involved in the management and in the\\nupdate of the DLTs check the integrity and the consistency\\nof the data, ensuring the correctness of the system.\\nMost of the DLTs are permissionless, meaning that no\\nprior approval to actively participate in the system is\\nneeded.\\nThere can be different implementations of a distributed\\nledger but most of the cryptocurrencies rely on the\\nblockchain, a data structure that stores the transactions\\ninto containers called blocks, logically linked among each\\nother through the use of cryptographic techniques. All\\nthe cryptocurrencies require a consensus strategy that\\nallows all the nodes of the system to agree about the\\nactual state of the distributed ledger. Also in this case,\\ndifferent schemes are available, but the most popular\\nimplementations use the so-called Proof of Work (PoW),\\nrequiring to solve computationally intensive crypto-puzzles\\nin order to validate the blocks and the transactions contained\\ntherein. The act of solving the cryptographic puzzles\\nis called “mining”. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency\\nlaunched in the market and still now is the most famous\\nand the most used one. Recently, also Ethereum gained\\npopularity because it allows to execute, other than simple\\ntransactions, actual contracts written with code, the so called\\n“smart contracts”.\\nIn most of the systems, users are identified with\\naddresses derived from their public cryptographic key and\\nthere is no trivial way to associate the addresses with the real\\nidentity of the users. So it is possible (and often happens)\\nthat certain users control multiple accounts and that multiple\\naddresses are linked to a single account.\\n 840\\nPeer-to-Peer Netw. Appl. (2022) 15:839–853\\n\\n2.2 Graphs and complex systems\\n A graph can be an effective way to represent systems\\nor parts of systems where different entities interact.\\nSpecifically, a graph G is a data structure defined as G =\\n(V, E) where V is a set of entities called nodes or vertices\\nand E is a set of edges, which are links representing\\nconnections between pairs of nodes. In directed graphs,\\nthe link relation is not necessarily commutative, while\\nin undirected graphs the edges symbolize links in both\\ndirections: that means that if A is connected with B then\\nB is also connected with A. Graphs can also be either\\nweighted or unweighted, depending if the edges are marked\\nwith weights, i.e. numerical values that are able to represent\\ndifferent measures depending on the meaning of the graph\\nsuch as distances, economical costs, number of interactions,\\netc.\\nIn a graph, it is not always possible to reach each\\ncouple of nodes by following a path along the edges. A\\nsubgraph including all the nodes that can communicate with\\neach other, through a certain path, is called a “connected\\ncomponent”. There can be various connected components\\nin a graph, and usually the component with the largest\\nnumber of nodes is referred to as the “main component”.\\nIn directed graphs a component can either be strongly or\\nweakly connected: in the first case all the couples of nodes\\ncan communicate in both directions, in the second case the\\ncommunication might be possible just in one direction.\\nDepending on the problem, the meaning of a graph can\\nbe different. In a map, for example, vertices may represent\\nsome locations and the weights of the edges are the distance\\nbetween two nodes [14–16]. In our case, the vertices are\\naddresses of a certain blockchain and the presence of an\\nedge indicates that there has been an interaction between the\\ntwo nodes (i.e. a transaction).\\n 2.3 Network topologies\\n The structure of a network can be described through some\\nmathematical properties of the associate graph. Here, we\\nfocus on two specific graph topologies, i.e. random graphs\\nand small world graphs.\\nThe random graphs are networks completely generated\\nby random processes and where no presence of hubs or\\nskewed distribution is expected to occur. A typical method\\nto generate a synthetic random graph is the Erdos-Renyi\\nmodel [30]: it is an algorithm that takes as arguments (i)\\nthe number of nodes to be created and (ii) either the total\\nnumber of edges or the probability that a link between\\ntwo nodes exists. Then, the algorithm proceeds to consult\\niteratively random sources to decide where edges are going\\nto be placed.\\n Small world networks [39] are a graph topology where\\nusually two nodes are connected by a low number of hops\\nand where often neighbor nodes share other neighbors\\nin common. Frequently, these graphs are characterized\\nby the presence of cliques (i.e. subgraphs where each\\ncouple of nodes is directly linked) and hubs, which serve\\nas connectors among highly clustered groups of nodes.\\nSeveral examples of real networks that exhibit a small\\nworld structure exist, i.e. food chains, electric power\\ngrids, neural networks, telephone call graphs and social\\ninfluence networks. Detecting if a graph is a small world\\ncan be useful in various application areas. For example,\\nin medicine it can give information about how a disease\\nspreads within a population, while in telecommunications\\nand computer science it is possible to exploit the knowledge\\non the structuring of the graph in order to optimize the\\ndissemination and the storage of data [9].\\nTwo metrics are commonly used in order to evaluate if a\\ngraph has a small world property [3]:\\n –\\nAverage shortest path length (ASPL). In unweighted\\ngraphs, the shortest path is the path that connects\\ntwo nodes with the minimum number of hops. The\\nASPL is thus calculated averaging the shortest paths\\namong all the couples of connected nodes. The shortest\\npath can be computed by using the classic Dijkstra’s\\nalgorithm [11], and the procedure is iterated for n∗(n−\\n1) times in the worst case. The overall time complexity\\nof the algorithm is O(|V |2|E| + |V |3log|V |).\\n–\\nAverage clustering coefficient (ACC). The clustering\\ncoefficient of a node is the fraction that indicates the\\npercentage of the neighbors of such a node that are\\nin turn directly linked. It basically tells how much the\\nfriends of a node (i.e. the node neighbors) are friends\\namong themselves. The average clustering coefficient\\nof the whole network is obtained by averaging the\\nclustering coefficients of all the nodes. It produces an\\noutput ranging from 0 to 1: the higher the value the\\nmore clustered is the graph.\\n The two mentioned metrics can be used to characterize a\\nsmall network as follows. Such values have to be compared\\nwith a random graph, created with the same number of\\nnodes and edges. Then, one can state that the graph features\\nsmall world properties if, compared to a random graph of the\\nsame size, the average clustering coefficient is significantly\\nhigher and the average shortest path length similar (or\\nsmaller) [15].\\nIn practice, all this can be measured by computing the\\nfollowing metrics\\n σ =\\n C\\nCr\\nL\\nLr\\n 841\\nPeer-to-Peer Netw. Appl. (2022) 15:839–853\\n\\nIn this last formula, C is the ACC of the analyzed graph\\nand Cr is the ACC of the random graph. Similarly, L is\\nthe ASPL of the analyzed graph and Lr is the ASPL of the\\nrandom graph. The higher σ, the more pronounced the small\\nworld behaviour is.\\nOther graph topologies exist, for example scale-free\\nnetworks are characterized by the degree distribution\\nfollowing a power law. In these types of graphs there are few\\nhubs connected with a large number of nodes, while most of\\nthe nodes are scarcely connected [8].\\n 3 The DiLeNa tool\\n The proposed software, that is freely available on the\\nresearch group website [10], is modular and it is composed\\nof two main components (as shown in Fig. 1):\\n –\\nGraph Generator: it is in charge of downloading the\\ntransactions of the examined DLT, generated during the\\ntime interval of interest. Then, a directed graph is built,\\nthat represents the interactions among the nodes. The\\nvertices of the graph correspond to the addresses in the\\nDLT and, for each transaction, an edge directed from\\nthe sender to the recipient of the transactions is made (if\\nnot already existing).\\n–\\nGraph Analyzer: this module is in charge of calculating\\nthe typical metrics related to the obtained graph. Among\\nthe others, the tool is able to measure the degree\\ndistribution, network clustering coefficient, as well as\\nto identify the main component and some of its main\\nmetrics, such as the average shortest path. Moreover,\\nthe tool computes if the network is a small world, by\\ncomparing it with a corresponding random graph (with\\nthe same amount of nodes and edges).\\n The generated graph is stored in Pajek format [34].\\nThis format is particularly efficient for our scope, since\\nit is an optimized data encoding format for graphs, that\\nallows to save space, by mapping the addresses (represented\\nby hexadecimal strings of about 40 characters each) with\\n an incremental integer. For example, one day of Bitcoin\\ntransactions (e.g. 1st September 2020) needed 125.8 MB to\\nbe stored in Pajek format, while with the standard JSON\\nrepresentation, the amount of memory consumed was 368.6\\nMB.\\n 3.1 Graph generator\\n As already mentioned, this module is in charge of retrieving\\na set of transactions, by inspecting the distributed ledger\\nrelated to the cryptocurrencies under study. Needless to say,\\nevery DLT stores its transactions according to a different\\nencoding format. Moreover, each DLT typically provides\\nits own set of specific Application Programming Interfaces\\n(APIs) to inquiry the ledger and retrieve contents. Thus,\\nfor each DLT a different data retrieval methodology (and\\nsoftware module) has been implemented.\\nFor instance, as concerns Ripple, a Python library\\nis available, named python-ripple-lib, which allows to\\ndownload up to 100 transactions given a certain period\\nof time. Due to such a limit, in case that larger datasets\\nare required, multiple requests have to be performed,\\nuntil the whole time interval of interest is covered.\\nRegarding Ethereum, in a previous version of DiLeNa,\\nthe transactions were downloaded by using Infura, a\\nservice that provides access to a remote Ethereum node\\nthrough APIs. However, recent restrictions on the free\\nversion of Infura lead us to lean on Etherscan.io, a\\nblock explorer and analytics platform for Ethereum.\\nDogecoin’s transactions are retrieved from the website\\nSoChain [35], which offers the functionality of blockchain\\nexplorer. The site also shows the content of other\\nblockchains, like ZCash, Litecoin and Dash. So extending\\nthe software for such distributed ledgers should be trivial\\nwork. Finally, in order to get Bitcoin transactions, we\\nuse the “curl” library to query the Blockchain.info [4]\\nwebsite.\\nMore specifically, the download phase was designed to\\nfollow a parallel approach: the user can optionally define the\\nnumber of concurrent workers to use (1 by default) in order\\n Fig. 1 DiLeNA’s modular design: the graph generator retrieves the transactions graph of a certain DLT and then the graph analyzer calculates the\\nrequested metrics\\n 842\\nPeer-to-Peer Netw. Appl. (2022) 15:839–853\\n\\nto better share the workload for the requests of blocks and\\ntransactions.\\n 3.2 Graph analyzer\\n This module has been specifically implemented in Python\\nin order to have a seamless interaction with the NetworkX\\nlibrary, a software package for the analysis and the\\nmanipulation of graphs and complex networks [18].\\nUnder the usage viewpoint, the Graph Analyzer enables\\nthe user to specify what graph is to be analyzed and then to\\ncompute some metrics provided by NetworkX. In particular,\\nfor our scope we are mainly interested in:\\n –\\nDegree Distribution;\\n–\\nAverage Clustering Coefficient (ACC);\\n–\\nAverage Shortest Path Length (ASPL) of the main\\ncomponent.\\n After completing these computations, the Graph Ana-\\nlyzer generates a new random graph with the same number\\nof nodes and an equivalent number of edges using the well-\\nknown Erdos-Renyi model. This makes possible a compar-\\nison between the two graphs that is necessary to find if the\\nnetworks that are analyzed have small world properties. It\\nis worth noticing that, also in this case, we implemented the\\ncomputation of the metrics enabling a parallel execution. In\\nfact, the user has the chance to define the number of workers\\nto be used (a single worker is used by default).\\n 3.3 Design and implementation issues\\n To be able to perform the analysis described above, the first\\nissue that needs to be properly addressed is how to automate\\nthe download of transactions from the DLTs. Generally\\nspeaking there are two main options for downloading slices\\nof a distributed ledger:\\n –\\nAn API that, among other things, allows downloading\\nblocks and/or transactions.\\n–\\nBlocks and/or transactions are available (usually in\\nJSON format) on certain web pages. In this case,\\nonce the indices of blocks corresponding to the desired\\nperiod of time are found, all one has to do is to iterate\\nrequests to the site by using the right parameters.\\n There are also cryptocurrencies, however, for which none of\\nthe two methods is available. Thus, if one wanted to retrieve\\nthe data of such cryptocurrencies, it would be necessary to\\ndownload the full distributed ledger, often made of hundreds\\nof gigabytes. Furthermore, there are some cryptocurrencies\\nlike Monero with a particular focus on privacy that prevent\\nthe observer from accessing some information. Monero\\nis built on top of a public blockchain, but most of its\\nportions are encrypted. Senders, recipients and amounts\\n being transferred are hidden to third parties through the use\\nof stealth addresses, RingCT and Bulletproofs [23].\\nAnother problematic aspect concerns the parallelization\\nof the download. In the proposed version of the software (for\\nRipple, Ethereum and Dogecoin) the user can specify the\\nnumber of workers that will manage the retrieval of blocks\\nand transactions. Though, it happens frequently that the\\nserver replies with a 429 HTTP status code, indicating that\\na rate limit mechanism is implemented and that too many\\nrequests have been issued. When this occurs, the program is\\npaused for a few seconds before resuming its activity. Thus,\\nit is advised to use a limited number of concurrent workers\\nin order to not overload the servers with too many requests.\\nOnce the transactions are downloaded, the biggest\\nconcern is how to calculate the metrics linked with the\\nshortest path in a reasonable amount of time. For example,\\nthe average shortest path length can require up to several\\nmonths to complete, while metrics such as the clustering\\ncoefficient or the degree distribution are almost immediate\\nto compute. A parallel approach can significantly reduce\\nthe amount of time required for the metrics, sharing the\\nworkload among multiple workers (i.e. each worker can be\\nexecuted on a different CPU core). However, this may not be\\nsufficient to get the results in an acceptable amount of time,\\nso it could be necessary to only consider a random sample\\nof nodes on which to calculate the shortest path length.\\nAnother problem that arises with large-scale graphs is\\nthat their representation in a data structure could exceed\\nthe space available in RAM on the computer used for the\\nanalysis. This often requires a more complex management\\nof the memory and a costly (in terms of time) access to the\\nsecondary storage. To mitigate this issue, the adoption of\\nthe Pajek format, to represent the generated graphs, can be\\nreally useful. In fact, it saves a lot of space with respect to\\nthe JSON format that is often used. For example, a single\\nmonth of Ethereum transactions required 1.9 GBs to be\\nstored in JSON and just 540 MBs in Pajek.\\n 4 Analysis of the results\\n In this section, the outcomes of our analyses are discussed.\\nAs mentioned, we will report the outcomes from Bitcoin,\\nDogeCoin, Ethereum and Ripple.\\n 4.1 Setup, methodologies and performance\\n Our main intention was to analyze the behavior of the\\nmost popular cryptocurrencies’ ledgers in a specific time-\\nframe (i.e. all the transactions in a specific day or month,\\nin our case either 1st September 2020 or the entire month\\nof September 2020). While most of the metrics do not\\nrequire a lot of time to be calculated, the average shortest\\n 843\\nPeer-to-Peer Netw. Appl. (2022) 15:839–853\\n\\npath length is very critical timewise. In order to mitigate\\nthis problem, we investigated the viability to consider just\\na sample of the nodes of the main weakly connected\\ncomponent, thus reducing the number of times that Dijkstra\\nalgorithm needs to be applied. For example, with a sample\\nof 1/n nodes, just 1/n2 of the total paths of the main\\ncomponent need to be computed. From our experiments\\n(Table 1), it turns out that the difference between the actual\\nresults and the sampled results is negligible (around 1%\\nof difference using a sample including 10% of the nodes).\\nThus, for the sake of computation, we decided to adopt such\\na technique. However, even with the use of samples, the\\nDijkstra algorithm remains time-dependent on the number\\nof nodes and edges of the main component, therefore\\ncalculating the average shortest path length on very big\\ngraphs always remains very time consuming.\\nDifferent sample sizes were applied, depending on the\\nsize of the graph. For example, to study one month of Ripple\\ntransactions we used a 20% sample. The analysis took 19\\nhours to complete, 6h37m for the retrieved graph and the\\nrest for the random graph. In this case, the generation of\\nthe random graph only lasted 10 minutes, but in other cases\\nit is a very long operation, requiring up to some days. The\\nserver used for conducting this analysis is equipped with an\\nIntel Xeon CPU E3-1245 (v5 @ 3.50GHz) running Ubuntu\\n18.04.5 LTS.\\nAnalyzing one day of Ethereum transactions (sample:\\n10%) required 14 hours, most of them (i.e. 11h35m) for\\ncomputing the ASPL of the random graph. In general, to\\ncalculate the metrics on the random graph is much more\\ntime consuming compared to the retrieved graph. This is due\\nto the higher ASPL, always detected in the random graphs,\\nwhich directly protracts the time required to compute such\\na metric.\\n 4.2 Ripple\\n Released in 2013, Ripple is both a cryptocurrency and\\na platform that allows, with negligible fees (only there\\nto prevent Denial-of-Service attacks), to connect banks,\\npayment providers and digital asset exchanges, by offering\\na solution for real-time money transfers that could be\\nslow and costly due to different countries and currencies\\ninvolved. Ripple was thought as a bridge currency between\\n Table 1 Analysis of the Ripple’s transactions graph: one day of\\ntransactions, comparison of different samples size\\n Sample Size\\nMain Component ASPL\\nDifference\\n 10%\\n4.4548\\n0.98%\\n25%\\n4.395\\n0.37%\\n100%\\n4.4116\\n–\\n fiat currencies when making cross-border payments or\\nbetween crypto and fiat currencies. Unlike most of the\\ncryptocurrencies, Ripple does not use a blockchain as a\\ndistributed ledger. Transactions are stored in a network\\nmade of independent validating nodes that constantly\\ncompare their transaction records and the consensus\\nis achieved by using the Ripple Protocol Consensus\\nAlgorithm. Ripple has the advantage of being extremely\\nfast to validate transactions, achieving to validate up\\nto 1500 transactions per second [25], against the 7\\ntransactions per second manageable by Bitcoin in its\\nmaximum throughput [6]. However, unlike most of the other\\ncryptocurrencies, the system is not fully decentralized, since\\nall the Ripple tokens are pre-mined but only some of them\\nare available to the market, being periodically released at the\\ndiscretion of the company that controls the system, Ripple\\nLab [20]. At the time of writing (i.e. April 2021), Ripple\\nis the forth cryptocurrency by market capitalization, only\\nbehind Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance Coin [1].\\nAnother interesting characteristic of Ripple is that it is\\npossible to avoid the noise caused by the presence of change\\naddresses, created in Bitcoin-like systems when a part of\\nthe input has to be returned to the sender of a transaction.\\nRipple allows for different types of transactions [2] like the\\ncreation or the removal of accounts, payment channels and\\nescrows. However, here we focus on payments, since they\\nare the only type of transaction through which it is possible\\nto directly map a sender and a receiver of economical funds.\\nFigure 2 shows the degree distribution of the graph\\nresulting from one day of Ripple transactions (September\\n1st, 2020). Most of the nodes interacted just sporadically,\\nwith more than 7 out of 10 nodes just having either\\nincoming or outgoing edges but not both of them. It\\nalso turned out that the number of nodes with 0 as out-\\ndegree is almost double compared to the nodes that never\\nreceived a transaction. Moreover, there are few hubs with\\na large number of interactions. The node with highest\\ndegree (i.e. the most connected node), for example, had\\nconnections with 1125 nodes, that is 11.58% of the whole\\nnetwork.\\nAfter this preliminary evaluation, we have collected and\\nanalyzed a full month of transactions (i.e. September 2020).\\nThe obtained results are reported in Fig. 3. It is worth noting\\nthat, as expected, there are fewer nodes with a very low\\ndegree distribution with respect to the previous graph. This\\nis due to the fact that there are some nodes that may have\\na single interaction in one day, but multiple in a longer\\ntime period. As a result, the percentage of nodes with just\\none interaction dropped from 71.6% (as reported in the\\nfirst graph) to the 59.5% in the second graph. Regarding\\nthe hubs, there are 4 nodes with more than 10 000 edges,\\nwith the most connected one having connections with 15%\\nof the nodes. Here 95% of the nodes belong to the main\\n 844\\nPeer-to-Peer Netw. Appl. (2022) 15:839–853\\n\\nFig. 2 In, out and total degree distribution of the Ripple graph.

This\\nhappens because a significant part of the transactions carried\\nout in 30 days were performed among nodes that already\\ndirectly interacted, thus no new node nor new link is added\\nto the network. In fact, in the one-day graph, 84% of the\\ntransactions happened between two addresses that already\\ncommunicated in that direction, and this percentage rises to\\n93.6% in the one-month graph.\\nTable 3 shows the outcome of the computed metrics.\\nWe can state that the transactions graph has a small world\\nbehaviour both considering one day and one month of\\ninteractions. In the first case, the ratio of the average shortest\\npath lengths is 0.28 and the clustering coefficient of the\\nRipple graph is almost 600 times greater compared to the\\nrandom graph. In the second case the ratio of the average\\nshortest path lengths is similar (0.24) and ratio of the\\naverage clustering coefficient is even considerably higher\\n(12512).\\nThe tests over one month of Ripple transactions were\\nrepeated changing configuration for the evaluation of the\\naverage shortest path. By default, the ASPL is calculated\\namong the nodes belonging to the main weakly connected\\ncomponent, considering only the couple of nodes that are\\nactually connected.

Finally, the test was repeated\\nconsidering the graph as undirected. Here, some differences\\noccur: first of all the clustering coefficient is higher, as a\\ndirect consequence of the increased number of links. Then,\\nfor the same reason, the ASPL is lower (3.12). However,\\ntaking into account the comparison with a similar random\\ngraph, also in this case we can state that the transactions\\ngraph has small world properties, even though both the ratio\\nare slightly higher.\\nFinally, the load centrality was computed for the most\\nconnected hubs of the system. The load centrality of a node\\nis the fraction of all shortest paths that pass through that\\nnode. Table 2 shows that, in general, the more the nodes are\\nconnected the more the load centrality tends to be high, even\\nif a strict correlation cannot be claimed (Table 3).\\n 4.3 Bitcoin\\n In Bitcoin, accounts are addresses composed of alphanu-\\nmeric characters, generated by applying a hash function\\n 846\\nPeer-to-Peer Netw.

Since UTXO inputs must be spent entirely,\\nwhen the sum of the pointed inputs of a transaction is\\ngreater than the actual expenditure, then the unspent part\\nof the inputs are sent back to the original owner, similarly\\nto the change someone receives after conducting a cash\\ntransaction in a store. For change operations, often differ-\\nent addresses are used (the so-called change addresses) [28],\\nin order to enhance the privacy while making more diffi-\\ncult the traceability of the blockchain. In fact, there can be\\nmultiple addresses linked to a given wallet. Furthermore,\\nunlike Ripple and Ethereum (where a transaction can only\\nhave a single address as sender and another one as recipi-\\nent), transactions with multiple inputs and multiple outputs\\nare allowed: in these cases, for our analysis the n input\\naddresses are mapped with the m output addresses, result-\\ning in n ∗ m links. This is possible since one wallet can\\nhave multiple receiving addresses; thus, one can collect the\\nUTXO associated with these addresses to create a single\\ntransaction.\\nSimilarly to other graphs, the analysis of the Bitcoin\\ndegree distribution shows the presence of very few hubs.\\nHowever, here the percentage of active nodes involved with\\nmore than 5 accounts in daily transactions is greater than\\n10%, a significantly higher fraction with respect to the other\\ndistributed ledgers (see Fig. 4). This is probably due to the\\ntransactions with multiple addresses as input and/or output.\\nThe peculiar thing about the Bitcoin graph is that the most\\nconnected node has a degree (35 597 connections, whose\\n21 729 are incoming edges) that is almost 8 times greater\\nthan the degree of the second most connected node. Such a\\nnode is linked with the 4% of the other active nodes in the\\nnetwork.\\nLike the previously analyzed graph, also the Bitcoin\\ntransactions graph has a small world property. However,\\nas we can observe from Table 4, the ratio of the average\\nshortest path length of the transactions graph and the\\nrandom graph is 0.69, the highest among our analyses.\\n 4.4 Ethereum\\n Ethereum, unlike Bitcoin, does not rely on a UTXO model\\nto retrieve the balance of the accounts [19]. Similarly to\\nbanks, each account has a balance, which increases when it\\nreceives Ethers, and decreases when it sends Ethers to other\\nusers. Thus, there is no need for change addresses, because\\nall the transactions simply deduct from one account and\\nadd to another. In addition, there are two types of Ethereum\\naccounts [38]:\\n –\\nprivate key controlled user accounts;\\n–\\ncontract code-controlled accounts.\\n Each contract can be identified by its Ethereum address in\\nthe same way a normal Ethereum user can. In Ethereum,\\nfrom the standpoint of the blockchain, transactions have a\\nsingle address both as sender and as recipient. This differs\\nfrom Bitcoin where transactions with multiple inputs and\\nmultiple outputs are allowed.\\nUnlike Ripple, just 25.4% of the Ethereum transactions\\npass through already existing edges, thus the main part of\\nthe payments are carried out among nodes that have not\\ncommunicated between each other in that 24 hours interval.\\nThis percentage grows to 48.4% taking into account the full\\nmonth. The degree distribution resulting from our analysis\\nshows that also here there are few nodes with a very\\nhigh degree, thus implying the presence of hubs. Figure 5\\nshows the degree distribution of the graph resulting from\\nthe transactions performed on 1st September 2020. With\\n322 467 nodes and just 376 587 edges, it turns out that\\n80.75% of the nodes belongs to the main weakly connected\\ncomponent. Almost 2/3 of the nodes just had interactions\\nwith another node and there are 10 nodes with a degree\\ngreater than 4000, including two giant hubs, the first one\\nhaving incoming edges with the 9.45% of the network and\\nthe second one having outgoing edges with 7.7% of the\\nnodes. Considering one month of transactions (September\\n2020) we have slight differences, as we can notice in Fig. 6.\\nThe ratio edges-nodes is now slightly higher (1.47, versus\\n1.17 of the one day transactions graph) and the percentage\\nof nodes with just one interactions fell from 63.66% to\\n51.59%.

In\\nfact, the ratio of the average clustering coefficient between\\nthe transactions graph and the random graph is 14 320, and\\nthe ASPL ratio is 0.13. Regarding the load centrality of the\\nhubs, unlike Ripple, very few shortest paths pass through the\\nmost connected hubs. Figure 2b shows that among the ten\\nmost connected nodes, just one has a load centrality value\\ngreater than 1%.\\nThe website “Etherscan.io” allows to visualize, other\\nthan normal transactions, also the so called internal\\ntransactions, which are some kind of interactions that\\noccurred between two smart contracts. Despite the name,\\nthey are not actually considered real transactions, since they\\nare not directly included in the blockchain. An internal\\ntransaction is triggered whenever a smart contract needs\\nto send Ethers, Tokens or make some sort of mechanic\\non its own. The degree distribution of Ethereum internal\\ntransactions resulted as particularly unbalanced: in the one-\\nday graph 99% of the addresses just either sent or received\\none transaction (99.38% in the one-month graph) while the\\nmost clustered hub has incoming connections with 36.8%\\nof the nodes (41.1% in the one-month graph). This happens\\ndespite having a similar edges-nodes ratio (around 1.1) with\\nrespect to the Ethereum graphs with normal transactions.\\n 4.5 DogeCoin\\n Dogecoin is a Litecoin based cryptocurrency, launched in\\nDecember 2013. Similarly to Bitcoin, it features Proof-of-\\nWork as a consensus protocol and the accounts rely on\\na UTXO model to get the balance of the accounts (thus\\nseveral change addresses will appear). Transactions with\\nmultiple inputs and multiple outputs are allowed. Like\\nBitcoin, several input addresses in a transaction can indicate\\nthat these multiple addresses are associated to the same user.\\nIn particular, in our analysis 55 212 transactions have led\\nto 513 759 binary connections between addresses and to a\\ntotal of 143 641 directed edges in the resulting graph. Most\\nof the transactions were composed of 1-2 inputs and 1-2\\noutputs, however few transactions with a very big number of\\naddresses involved were detected. For example, the largest\\ninvolved 167 input addresses and 1141 output addresses.\\n 848\\nPeer-to-Peer Netw. Appl.

As expected, also in\\nthis case there are few hubs including 7 nodes with a degree\\ngreater than 1000 and the most connected node that is linked\\nwith the 12.3% of the network and through which 21% of\\nthe shortest paths pass (see Table 2c).\\n 4.6 Outcome analysis\\n The results reported above show that the transaction\\ngraphs of all the analyzed cryptocurrencies have small-\\nworld properties, even though some of them have a more\\npronounced behaviour than others.\\nRegarding one day analyses, Ethereum showed by far\\nthe lowest ASPL ratio (0.13), followed by Ripple (0.27),\\nDogecoin (0.68) Bitcoin (0.69). On the other hand, for\\nwhich concerns the ACC ratio, Ethereum and Bitcoin had a\\nvalue greater than 10 000, while Ripple and Dogecoin had\\na value between 500 and 1000. This is probably because\\nthe clusterization level generally tends to grow when the\\nsize of the graph increases. In fact Ripple, considering a full\\nmonth of transactions instead of just one day, has an average\\nclustering coefficient ratio over 10 000 as well.\\nSeveral factors must be taken into account when\\ninterpreting the results, such as:\\n –\\nThe presence of change addresses in Dogecoin and\\nBitcoin.\\n–\\nThe role of the smart contracts in Ethereum (interac-\\ntions among groups of users are performed through\\nsmart contracts, that thus become common network\\nneighbors to all these users).\\n–\\nThe existence of exchange platforms that are connected\\nto a lot of nodes.\\n Table 6 Comparison between the Dogecoin graph and the equivalent\\nrandom graph\\n Graph\\nGraph ACC\\nMain Component\\nASPL\\nMain Component\\nACC\\n Dogecoin\\n0.06665\\n5.1633\\n0.06819\\nRandom\\n0.0000799\\n7.6305\\n0.0000763\\n Fig. 7 In, out and total degree distribution of the Dogecoin graph.\\nBased on the transactions dated: 1st September 2020.

Figure 8 shows that Ripple has considerably\\nmore transactions compared to the number of addresses\\ninvolved with respect to other DLTs. In addition, Ripple\\npayments-addresses ratio is very irregular, particularly\\nbecause the number of involved accounts is subject to severe\\nfluctuations. In Dogecoin, on the other hand, the number of\\nactive nodes is greater than the number of transactions.\\n Fig. 8 Transactions - active addresses ratio, data from the first day of\\neach quarter since late 2015 (Jan 1st, Apr 1st, Jul 1st, Oct 1st)\\n All the analyzed graphs show the presence of hubs,\\nwhile most of the nodes have very few connections.\\nThis is probably due to the presence of cryptocurrencies\\nexchange platforms (e.g. Binance), which interact with a\\nlot of accounts that aim to convert fiat currencies into\\ncryptocurrencies or vice versa. By observing the degree\\ndistribution results, we note that the plots in logarithmic\\nscale look pseudo-linear. In fact, in all these charts the first\\npart of the line representing the degree distribution well\\napproximates a linear decade, thus suggesting a power law\\nrelation. Then, a tail is present with a minimal amount of\\nnodes with much higher degrees (than others). This suggests\\nthat the considered networks might have a weak scale-free\\nstructure [5].\\n 5 Conclusions\\n In this paper, we presented the Distributed Ledger\\nNetwork Analyzer (DiLeNA), a new software tool designed\\nfor downloading the transactions recorded in certain\\nDistributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) and to compute a\\nset of metrics on the resulting interaction graph. Based on\\nthe current version of DiLeNa, we studied four prominent\\nDLTs: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dogecoin and Ripple. Our\\nanalyses revealed that all the transactions graphs taken into\\naccount exhibit small world properties, although in certain\\ncases such behaviour is more pronounced. Furthermore,\\nfrom our tests it turns out that by stretching the period of\\ntime considered for the analyses (in our case from one day\\nto one month) the small world behaviour becomes more\\nmarked in the observed graphs. This is because while the\\nACC of the random graphs tends to decrease when the size\\ngrows, the ACC of the transactions networks remains stable\\nor even increases, causing the ACC ratio to be higher.\\nAs reported before, the modular structure of DiLeNa\\npermits to easily add the support for other DLTs, although it\\nis not always possible to find a way to efficiently automatize\\nthe download of the transactions given a range of time.\\n 851\\nPeer-to-Peer Netw. Appl. (2022) 15:839–853\\n\\nAnother future extension of DiLeNa aims to further increase\\nthe computation parallelization throught GPUs. In this case,\\nthe main bottleneck is the lack of support for GPUs in the\\ncurrent version of the NetworkX library used for computing\\nsome of the metrics described in the paper. In other words,\\nthis will require us to switch to another library or to embed\\nthe metrics computation in DiLeNa using a more efficient\\nprogramming language.\\n Funding Open access funding provided by Universit`a degli Studi di\\nUrbino Carlo Bo within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.\\n Open Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons\\nAttribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing,\\nadaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as\\nlong as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the\\nsource, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate\\nif changes were made.

Unlike fiat currencies, however,\\ncryptocurrencies base their value exclusively on the trust\\nof the investors: except those implementations that base\\ntheir value on traditional financial assets (i.e. stablecoins\\nlike Tether or Security Token Offerings), no central\\nbanks and monetary reserves can influence the supply\\nof money and, as such, indirectly control inflation. Also\\nfor these motivations, often the economical value of the\\ncryptocurrencies is subject to high fluctuations.\\nBitcoin, launched in 2009, was the ancestor of all\\nthe other cryptocurrencies and it is even now by far the\\nmost popular and the most used one [29]. In view of\\nthe success of Bitcoin, many other cryptocurrencies were\\ncreated in the last decade: according to [1], currently there\\nare over 3500 types of cryptocurrencies, with the global\\ncryptomarket worth almost 400 billion dollars. However, as\\nreported by [1], Bitcoin still holds 64% of the cryptomarket\\ncapitalization, with Ethereum steadily in the second place\\nwith the 11%.\\nThe cryptomarket is currently still growing and there\\nare different reasons why one might be fascinated by\\nthis technology: some users might be interested in the\\nanonymity (or pseudo-anonymity) features [27], others in\\nthe lack of central entities in charge of managing the money\\ntransfers, in the economic value of the cryptocurrencies built\\nover these ledgers (for example, for speculation purposes),\\nor finally, with the aim to build decentralized applications\\n / Published online: 9 August 2021\\n Peer-to-Peer Networking and Applications (2022) 15:839–853\\n\\nthat are able to exploit the features offered by smart\\ncontracts [24].\\nBlockchains and cryptocurrencies have been widely\\nstudied in these last years. Mostly, the domains of\\ninvestigation are related to security issues [7, 26], usage\\nin Internet of Things deployments and drones [13,\\n33], Smart Cities environments [12, 21, 36], large-scale\\nheterogeneous networks [32], as well as on their economical\\nimpact [22].\\nIn this paper, we follow a totally different approach, in\\nfact we perform a study of these technologies by relying\\non mechanisms that are typical of the (social) networks\\nanalysis (e.g. [17, 37]). Thus, we study the interactions\\namong the accounts involved in the transactions that are\\nrecorded on the Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs).\\nFor this purpose, the system to be studied is treated as a\\ngraph, where links are drawn when pairs of accounts have\\na some sort of interaction. This kind of analysis is viable,\\nsince unlike normal methods for exchanging money, the\\nwhole set of transactions is traced in the distributed ledger\\nand furthermore it is visible to everyone [16].\\nTo this aim, we devised and implemented a novel\\nsoftware tool called DiLeNa (Distributed Ledger Network\\nAnalyzer)1.\\nThis software is able to grab the transactions stored in the\\ndistributed ledger of different DLTs, create an abstraction of\\na network and then measure some important related metrics,\\nwhich allow to extract some peculiar characteristics of the\\nnetwork.\\nWe claim that these metrics can provide insights on the\\nrespective technologies and on the use that users make of\\nthem.\\nSpecifically, in our work we apply this approach to four\\ndifferent DLTs, namely Bitcoin, DogeCoin, Ethereum and\\nRipple. The analysis on their transactions graphs reveals\\nthat the networks -some more, some less- feature a small\\nworld behaviour, and that most of the nodes have very few\\nconnections, even though some hubs with a very high degree\\nexist. The exhibited behaviour is supposed to be influenced\\nby the considered time interval and by the implementation\\nfeatures of the DLTs, so different types of transactions\\ngraphs have been taken into account. We think that the\\napproach we propose in this paper, should help to get more\\ninformation about how interactions through DLTs occur and\\nthat it could have useful applications, such as for anti-money\\nlaundering purposes.\\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows.\\nSection 2 introduces some background and related work.\\n 1An early version of this work appeared in [31]. This paper is an\\nextensively revised and extended version where more than 50% is new\\nmaterial.\\n Section 3 describes the design choices of the software tool\\nand deals with the critical aspects of its implementation.\\nSection 4 analyzes the results obtained by analyzing\\nthe some relevant distributed ledgers. Finally, Sections 5\\nprovides some concluding remarks.\\n 2 Background and related work\\n In this section, some background that is essential to\\nunderstand the rest of the paper is introduced. Specifically,\\nthe topics covered will be the DLT technology, the\\nrepresentation of complex systems as graphs and some\\nmetrics that can be used in order to evaluate the specific\\ncharacteristics of a network (e.g. small world property).\\n 2.1 DLT and blockchain technologies\\n Cryptocurrencies, unlike traditional banking systems, store\\ntheir data into distributed ledgers, thus making the\\ninformation decentralized and avoiding single points of\\nfailure. DLTs work as distributed and immutable databases\\nand the nodes involved in the management and in the\\nupdate of the DLTs check the integrity and the consistency\\nof the data, ensuring the correctness of the system.\\nMost of the DLTs are permissionless, meaning that no\\nprior approval to actively participate in the system is\\nneeded.\\nThere can be different implementations of a distributed\\nledger but most of the cryptocurrencies rely on the\\nblockchain, a data structure that stores the transactions\\ninto containers called blocks, logically linked among each\\nother through the use of cryptographic techniques. All\\nthe cryptocurrencies require a consensus strategy that\\nallows all the nodes of the system to agree about the\\nactual state of the distributed ledger. Also in this case,\\ndifferent schemes are available, but the most popular\\nimplementations use the so-called Proof of Work (PoW),\\nrequiring to solve computationally intensive crypto-puzzles\\nin order to validate the blocks and the transactions contained\\ntherein. The act of solving the cryptographic puzzles\\nis called “mining”. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency\\nlaunched in the market and still now is the most famous\\nand the most used one. Recently, also Ethereum gained\\npopularity because it allows to execute, other than simple\\ntransactions, actual contracts written with code, the so called\\n“smart contracts”.\\nIn most of the systems, users are identified with\\naddresses derived from their public cryptographic key and\\nthere is no trivial way to associate the addresses with the real\\nidentity of the users. So it is possible (and often happens)\\nthat certain users control multiple accounts and that multiple\\naddresses are linked to a single account.\\n 840\\nPeer-to-Peer Netw. Appl. (2022) 15:839–853\\n\\n2.2 Graphs and complex systems\\n A graph can be an effective way to represent systems\\nor parts of systems where different entities interact.\\nSpecifically, a graph G is a data structure defined as G =\\n(V, E) where V is a set of entities called nodes or vertices\\nand E is a set of edges, which are links representing\\nconnections between pairs of nodes. In directed graphs,\\nthe link relation is not necessarily commutative, while\\nin undirected graphs the edges symbolize links in both\\ndirections: that means that if A is connected with B then\\nB is also connected with A. Graphs can also be either\\nweighted or unweighted, depending if the edges are marked\\nwith weights, i.e. numerical values that are able to represent\\ndifferent measures depending on the meaning of the graph\\nsuch as distances, economical costs, number of interactions,\\netc.\\nIn a graph, it is not always possible to reach each\\ncouple of nodes by following a path along the edges. A\\nsubgraph including all the nodes that can communicate with\\neach other, through a certain path, is called a “connected\\ncomponent”. There can be various connected components\\nin a graph, and usually the component with the largest\\nnumber of nodes is referred to as the “main component”.\\nIn directed graphs a component can either be strongly or\\nweakly connected: in the first case all the couples of nodes\\ncan communicate in both directions, in the second case the\\ncommunication might be possible just in one direction.\\nDepending on the problem, the meaning of a graph can\\nbe different. In a map, for example, vertices may represent\\nsome locations and the weights of the edges are the distance\\nbetween two nodes [14–16]. In our case, the vertices are\\naddresses of a certain blockchain and the presence of an\\nedge indicates that there has been an interaction between the\\ntwo nodes (i.e. a transaction).\\n 2.3 Network topologies\\n The structure of a network can be described through some\\nmathematical properties of the associate graph. Here, we\\nfocus on two specific graph topologies, i.e. random graphs\\nand small world graphs.\\nThe random graphs are networks completely generated\\nby random processes and where no presence of hubs or\\nskewed distribution is expected to occur. A typical method\\nto generate a synthetic random graph is the Erdos-Renyi\\nmodel [30]: it is an algorithm that takes as arguments (i)\\nthe number of nodes to be created and (ii) either the total\\nnumber of edges or the probability that a link between\\ntwo nodes exists. Then, the algorithm proceeds to consult\\niteratively random sources to decide where edges are going\\nto be placed.\\n Small world networks [39] are a graph topology where\\nusually two nodes are connected by a low number of hops\\nand where often neighbor nodes share other neighbors\\nin common. Frequently, these graphs are characterized\\nby the presence of cliques (i.e. subgraphs where each\\ncouple of nodes is directly linked) and hubs, which serve\\nas connectors among highly clustered groups of nodes.\\nSeveral examples of real networks that exhibit a small\\nworld structure exist, i.e. food chains, electric power\\ngrids, neural networks, telephone call graphs and social\\ninfluence networks. Detecting if a graph is a small world\\ncan be useful in various application areas. For example,\\nin medicine it can give information about how a disease\\nspreads within a population, while in telecommunications\\nand computer science it is possible to exploit the knowledge\\non the structuring of the graph in order to optimize the\\ndissemination and the storage of data [9].\\nTwo metrics are commonly used in order to evaluate if a\\ngraph has a small world property [3]:\\n –\\nAverage shortest path length (ASPL). In unweighted\\ngraphs, the shortest path is the path that connects\\ntwo nodes with the minimum number of hops. The\\nASPL is thus calculated averaging the shortest paths\\namong all the couples of connected nodes. The shortest\\npath can be computed by using the classic Dijkstra’s\\nalgorithm [11], and the procedure is iterated for n∗(n−\\n1) times in the worst case. The overall time complexity\\nof the algorithm is O(|V |2|E| + |V |3log|V |).\\n–\\nAverage clustering coefficient (ACC). The clustering\\ncoefficient of a node is the fraction that indicates the\\npercentage of the neighbors of such a node that are\\nin turn directly linked. It basically tells how much the\\nfriends of a node (i.e. the node neighbors) are friends\\namong themselves. The average clustering coefficient\\nof the whole network is obtained by averaging the\\nclustering coefficients of all the nodes. It produces an\\noutput ranging from 0 to 1: the higher the value the\\nmore clustered is the graph.\\n The two mentioned metrics can be used to characterize a\\nsmall network as follows. Such values have to be compared\\nwith a random graph, created with the same number of\\nnodes and edges. Then, one can state that the graph features\\nsmall world properties if, compared to a random graph of the\\nsame size, the average clustering coefficient is significantly\\nhigher and the average shortest path length similar (or\\nsmaller) [15].\\nIn practice, all this can be measured by computing the\\nfollowing metrics\\n σ =\\n C\\nCr\\nL\\nLr\\n 841\\nPeer-to-Peer Netw.
